## Git log

[Git log](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) is used to track a branch's commit history. After committing, it will display information such as a commit history which can be used as reference or used to revert to previous commits.

To used it, we can simply use the command:

```
git log
```
<br>

Additionally, If you want to use the abbreviated output version of this, we can use the command:
```
git log --oneline
```
