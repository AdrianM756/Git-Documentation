[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open-source version control system that allow software development teams or alike to have multiple local copies of the project's code or file that are independent from each other.

## Installing Git

For this demo, we will be installing git on a [ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) machine. On the terminal tpye the command:

```
apt install git -y
```

The ``-y`` parameter answers yes to prompts without interrupting the process. to check the other options and syntax of ```apt```, you can visit this [link](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/apt-linux) for more info.

To verify that it is installed on our system, use the command:

```
dpkg -l | grep git
```

And to check the version, use the command:

```
git --version
```
