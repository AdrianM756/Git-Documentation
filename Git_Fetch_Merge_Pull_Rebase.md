## Git Fetch

[git fetch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fetch) is used to download contents from a remote repository, without combining it to your local branch. To do this, we can use the command:
```
git fetch
```

## Git Merge

[git merge](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge) allows you to combine 2 or more branches into 1 branch. We can achieve this using the command:
```
git merge
```
<br>

## Git pull

[git pull](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull) is like a combination of the ```git fetch``` and ```git mmerge``` command. It fetches the contents from the remote repository. Once it is downloaded, it will then merge it to the existing repository on the local system. To perform, we can use the command:
```
git pull
```

## Git Rebase

[git rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) is a process of integrating a series of commits on top of another base. It takes all the commits of a branch and appends them to the commits on the new branch. To perform this, we can use the command:
```
git rebase
```
